C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. Belowe are some simple tasks made with C

# C - Hello, World

[0-preprocessor](https://github.com/endritNovaku/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor) - Runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

[1-compiler](https://github.com/endritNovaku/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler) - Compiles a C file but does not link.

[2-assembler](https://github.com/endritNovaku/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler) - Generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

[3-name](https://github.com/endritNovaku/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/3-name) - Compiles a C file and creates an executable "cisfun" file.

[4-puts.c](https://github.com/endritNovaku/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c) - Prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line.

[5-printf.c](https://github.com/endritNovaku/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c) - Prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," followed by a new line

[6-size.c](https://github.com/endritNovaku/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c) - Prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
